/*
Linked lists were something I struggled with throughout this quarter. They share a lot of similarities with 
array lists which I also feel like I donâ€™t have a strong grasp on. The thing I think I struggle with the 
most for these is making sure I declare them properly and building the method calls correctly in another file. 
I was able to overcome my struggles with think lists by rereading over the zybooks module for it and watching 
some Youtube videos about them in my free time.

I picked this code for this topic because it was the first lab with linked lists and I struggled with it more
than the ones following it. ZyBooks Link: https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/SKAGITCS143WymanSpring2023/chapter/6/section/7
