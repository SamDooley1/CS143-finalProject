/*
Queues werenâ€™t too difficult of a concept to understand, having dealt with queues in everyday life 
like food lines, music queues, waiting for an operator on the phone when you call a service number, 
etc. While understanding the concept is important, it takes much more than that to properly implement 
it. But the something I struggled with a lot is in Lab 6.9 was getting the queue to output the counter 
with my proper position in the queue. Thinking back to when I was dealing with it I believe I overcame 
this by rearranging different things within my code to get my counter to track my queue position 
properly.
