In CS143 I struggled a lot more than in CS142 and I think this is because this class focuses a little more on thinking outside of the box. I think this is because this course seems more focused on combining some aspects of what we have learned before to overcome problems, whereas before it was more of learning the basics and applying one concept at a time. While giving us more ways to solve a problem may seem like a good thing, I find it can also be intimidating because you have so many possible solutions to think through. Just because something is intimidating doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing though, and I think this class really helped me grow by expanding my creative thinking and problem-solving skills alongside learning to write code more effectively.
